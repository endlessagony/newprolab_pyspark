I have successfully completed the Apache Spark course with a focus on PySpark, covering a range of tasks including data processing, machine learning, and real-time stream processing.

## Labs Completion

### 2. Recommendation Systems in PySpark
- Implemented recommendation systems using collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering techniques.
- Evaluated recommendation performance using various metrics.
  
### 3. Gradient Boosting and Classification Tasks
- Utilized PySpark's MLlib for implementing gradient boosting models to handle classification tasks.
- Explored feature engineering and evaluated model performance on test datasets.

### 4. Stream Classification
- Implemented real-time stream classification tasks using PySpark's streaming capabilities.
- Built scalable solutions to process streaming data and perform real-time classifications.

## Key Learnings
- Accomplished proficiency in working with large-scale datasets using PySpark for data processing and analysis.
- Expanded skills in deploying machine learning models for classification tasks utilizing PySpark's MLlib.
- Gained hands-on experience in stream processing, ensuring real-time responses to changing data streams.

I'm excited to apply these newfound skills and knowledge to real-world projects and continue my journey in the field of big data, machine learning, and real-time analytics using Apache Spark.

Looking forward to leveraging Apache Spark for scalable and efficient data processing and analytics!
